map, filter and reduce are higher order functions

**Reduce**
Take array and come up with singe value
reduce array to one value that is sum of array

map vs foreach
Map returns modified array whereas foreach doesnot return any array.
Map can be chained with filter, reduce etc but foreach cannot be chained as it doesnot return any array
