Call
function borrowing, it invokes function directly by passing ref that points out to this and takes remaining params

Apply:
same as call but takes 2nd argument as arraylist ad first argument is ref

Bind:
Doesnot directly invokes  the method but gives you copy of the method which we can invoke later.
Bind chaining doesnot exist
